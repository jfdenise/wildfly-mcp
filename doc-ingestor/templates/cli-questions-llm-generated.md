Your reply must only contain a generated question that should capture the idea of retrieving a value for the following text: description of the passivation attribute of the file store resource of the local-cache resource of the cache-container resource of the infinispan subsystem: If true, data is only written to the cache store when it is evicted from memory, a phenomenon known as 'passivation'. Next time the data is requested, it will be 'activated' which means that data will be brought back to memory and removed from the persistent store. If false, the cache store contains a copy of the contents in memory, so writes to cache result in cache store writes. This essentially gives you a 'write-through' configuration.

Can be used to provide a 'warm-cache' on startup, however there is a performance penalty as startup time is affected by this process.

## syntax of the operation to get the `passivation` attribute of the `remote` `store` resource of the `distributed-cache` resource of the `cache-container` resource of the `infinispan` subsystem
Your reply must only contain a generated question that should capture the idea of retrieving a value for the following text: description of the passivation attribute of the remote store resource of the distributed-cache resource of the cache-container resource of the infinispan subsystem: If true, data is only written to the cache store when it is evicted from memory, a phenomenon known as 'passivation'. Next time the data is requested, it will be 'activated' which means that data will be brought back to memory and removed from the persistent store. If false, the cache store contains a copy of the contents in memory, so writes to cache result in cache store writes. This essentially gives you a 'write-through' configuration.

## syntax of the operation to get the `passivation` attribute of the `remote` `store` resource of the `replicated-cache` resource of the `cache-container` resource of the `infinispan` subsystem
Your reply must only contain a generated question that should capture the idea of retrieving a value for the following text: description of the passivation attribute of the remote store resource of the replicated-cache resource of the cache-container resource of the infinispan subsystem: If true, data is only written to the cache store when it is evicted from memory, a phenomenon known as 'passivation'. Next time the data is requested, it will be 'activated' which means that data will be brought back to memory and removed from the persistent store. If false, the cache store contains a copy of the contents in memory, so writes to cache result in cache store writes. This essentially gives you a 'write-through' configuration.
