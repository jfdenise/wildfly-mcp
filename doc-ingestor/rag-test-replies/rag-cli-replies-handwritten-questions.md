## Mistral LLM reply

To retrieve the main attributes of the `http` socket binding in WildFly, you can use the following CLI operations:

1. To get the `http` socket binding details:
   ```shell
   /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=http:read-resource
   ```

2. To get the default interface if the `interface` attribute of the socket binding resource is not defined:
   ```shell
   /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets:read-attribute(name=default-interface)
   ```

3. To get the `http-listener` socket binding for the `undertow` subsystem:
   ```shell
   /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/http-listener=default:read-attribute(name=socket-binding)
   ```

4. To get the `https-listener` socket binding for the `undertow` subsystem:
   ```shell
   /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=default-https:read-attribute(name=socket-binding)
   ```

## question

What is the http port the server is bound to?

## directives

* syntax of the operation to get the `undertow` `server` `http-listener` `redirect-socket`
if this listener is supporting `non-ssl` requests, and a request is received for which a matching <`security-constraint`> requires `ssl` transport, undertow will automatically redirect the request to the socket binding port specified here.
get the `undertow` `server` `http-listener` `redirect-socket` attribute.
operation: `/subsystem=undertow/server=<server name>/http-listener=<http-listener name>:read-attribute(name=redirect-socket)`
* socket binding
A socket-binding contains the IP socket information: the port on the interface the server is bound to.
If the `interface` attribute of the socket binding resource is not defined, the `interface` attribute value has to be retrieved
by calling the operation `/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets:read-attribute(name=default-interface)`
Some well known socket-bindings are: http, https, management-http and management-https.
syntax of the operation to get a socket binding
operation: `/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=<socket binding name>:read-resource`
To get the list of all the interfaces use '*' for `<socket binding name>`.
* syntax of the operation to get the `undertow` `server` `http-listener` `socket-binding`
the listener socket binding
get the `undertow` `server` `http-listener` `socket-binding` attribute.
operation: `/subsystem=undertow/server=<server name>/http-listener=<http-listener name>:read-attribute(name=socket-binding)`
* syntax of the operation to get the `undertow` `server` `https-listener` `socket-binding`

get the `undertow` `server` `https-listener` `socket-binding` attribute.
