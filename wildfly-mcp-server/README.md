# WildFly MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@wildfly-extras/wildfly-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@wildfly-extras/wildfly-mcp-server)
A WildFly [MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) to integrate with your AI chatbot in order to interact with WildFly server using natural language.
This MCP server is a Java quarkus fat jar application that you can configure in your chatbot mcp configuration.

This MCP server (a Tool in AI terminologie) helps you troubleshoot running WildFly servers using natural language.
You can ask questions such as:

`Hi, could you get my WildFly server log file, analyze it and check for errors?`

## Download the latest WildFly MCP binary

You can download it from: `https://github.com/jfdenise/wildfly-mcp-server/releases/download/1.0.0.Alpha1/wildfly-mcp-server-1.0.0.Alpha1-runner.jar`

### Installing via Smithery

To install WildFly MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wildfly-extras/wildfly-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wildfly-extras/wildfly-mcp-server --client claude
```

## Build WildFly MCP fat jar

Make sure to use JDK21+.
 
`mvn clean install`

## Configure the chatbot

Add the following json to the chatbot configuration file:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wildfly": {
            "command": "java",
            "args": ["-jar",
                    "[path to the repository]/wildfly-mcp-server/target/wildfly-mcp-server-1.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar"]
    }
  }
}
``` 

If you are using [jbang](http://jbang.dev), you can add the following json content:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wildfly": {
            "command": "jbang",
            "args": ["--quiet",
                    "org.wildfly:wildfly-mcp-server:1.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT:runner"]
    }
  }
}
```

* For [claude.ai](http://claude.ai), on Fedora, add it to the file `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

* For [MCPHost](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcphost), add to a file named `mcp.json` and call: `./mcphost_Linux_x86_64/mcphost --config [path to the file]/mcp.json --model ollama:llama3.1:8b`

## Admin user credentials

The tools allow you to provide user name and password required to interact with a WildFly server directly in your question. 
You can set the user name and password in the tool shell command using the system properties `-Dorg.wildfly.user.name=<user name>` and `-Dorg.wildfly.user.password=<user password>`

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wildfly": {
            "command": "java",
            "args": ["-Dorg.wildfly.user.name=chatbot-user",
                     "-Dorg.wildfly.user.password=chatbot-user",
                     "-jar",
                     "[path to the repository]/wildfly-mcp-server/target/wildfly-mcp-server-1.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar"]
    }
  }
}
``` 
NOTE: It is not advised, in particular when connected to a non local LLM model to directly provide your credentials in the question you are 
asking to the chatbot. Use system properties (or env variables) that allow you to provide the password.

### Note on security

Allowing full access to your WildFly servers from the chatbot is not advised. Although you would then be able to call any WildFly management operations,
it must be done carefully. In particular when the chat bot is connected to a public LLM, no sentive information should be exposed.

When the chat bot interacts with a locally managed model (e.g.: locally managed `ollama` model, the default), this is less of a problem.
 
In any case it is advised that you benefit from the [WildFly RBAC](https://docs.wildfly.org/35/Admin_Guide.html#RBAC) configuration and define a user named `chatbot-user` with role `Monitor`.

Make sure to first add the user by invoking: `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/add-user.sh -p chatbot-user -u chatbot-user`

To enable RBAC, you can use the WildFly CLI command line and invoke the following commands:

```
/core-service=management/access=authorization:write-attribute(name=provider,value=rbac)
reload
/core-service=management/access=authorization/role-mapping=Monitor:add
/core-service=management/access=authorization/role-mapping=Monitor/include=chatbot-user:add(name=chatbot-user,type=USER)
```

When a user with the `Monitor` role is used, the following tools would fail:

* `enableWildFlyLoggingCategory` tool.

* `disableWildFlyLoggingCategory` tool.

In addition, write operations are not allowed when invoking the `invokeWildFlyCLIOperation` tool.

## Note on sensitive information

* Any sensitive information located in your server configuration file are not exposed when 
accessing to the server with the `chatbot-user` (actually any user with the `Monitor` role).

* WildFly server doesn't log sensitive information. Make sure that the deployments running in the WildFly servers are not logging sensitive information that could be exposed.

## Default WildFly server host and port
